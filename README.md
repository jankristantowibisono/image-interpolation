image-interpolation
===================

Image Interpolation using C++. 

This is my experiment project. I implemented Image Interpolation with C++ 
without any 3rd party library (Such as OpenCV or CImg). The algorithms that I implemented were
 - Nearest-Neighbor (simple explanation : http://jankristanto.com/info/nearest-neighbor-interpolation-for-resize-image/)
 - Bilinear
 - Bicubic
